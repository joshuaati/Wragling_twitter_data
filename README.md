# Twitter Archive Wrangling
## by Joshua Ati

## Dataset
> The dataset being wrangled (and analyzed and visualized) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. This project aimed at getting data from web based sources, identifying tidiness and quality issues and cleaning the data. Further EDA was conducted and visualizations plotted.
